Route planner web app requirements:

1 Shortest path algorithm:
	- dijkstra
	- bellman-ford
	- Floyd-Warshall Algo: good for multi-stops
	- Johnson's Algo: uses bellman-ford to detect negative cycles and ge		generates a new graph: on the new graph uses dijkstra for the sh	    shortest path
	- Viterbi algo
	- A* heuristic algo (is an advanced form of Breadth First Search)

(read-up on contraction hierarchies: wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies) 
two-dimensional Euclidian plane

2 Type of graph:
!!! google uses aa hierarchical structure on top of the graph.
!!! they also probably use some algo that can be made more efficient by keeping segments of popular routes in a cache.
	- Single source shortest path:
		- Undirected graph
		- Unweighted graph
		- Directed acyclic
		- Directed with nonnegative weights
		- Directed with arbitrary weights without negative cycles
		- Planar directed graphs with arbitrary weights
	- All pairs shortest paths:
		- Undirected
		- Directed
